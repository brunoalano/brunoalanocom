I'm CTO of Neurologic, a startup that uses deep learning and natural language processing to automate the conversations between companies and their customers. I'm focused in deep learning field using deep neural networks to solve real-world problems. Actually, I'm researching about deep unsupervised learning techniques, like using Autoencoders to improve accuracy Natural Language Tasks, instead of using techniques like PCA.

I was studying general artificial intelligence since my 15 years old, and software development since my 08 years old. After some years trying to work in descriptive logic to solve AI problems, I focused on Machine Learning perspective to solve them. With that, I focused on language tools, doing online courses from Jufrasky.
